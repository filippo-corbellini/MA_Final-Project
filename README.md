This repository hosts my Multivariate Analysis 2025 Final Project.
My project aims to replicate Federico Vegetti and Levente Littvay's "Belief in conspiracy theories and attitudes toward political violence" (2022) research article.
The original research article is available here: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/italian-political-science-review-rivista-italiana-di-scienza-politica/article/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-and-attitudes-toward-political-violence/89835D7B5CD9036BC8717E484D5F4C0B
The original paper's DOI is the following: https://doi.org/10.1017/ipo.2021.17
Data for the replication including original dataset and authors' R script is available here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/I7FSYP

The pdf file of my Final Project Replication Paper is in the folder "DOCS", it is called "Corbellini Filippo_Multivariate Analysis Final Assignment".
The R scrpit used for replication and extension is in the "SCRIPTS" folder and it is called "00_script".
These are the required R packages: "tidyverse", "rio", "corrplot", "psych", "lavaan", "semTools", "texreg".
